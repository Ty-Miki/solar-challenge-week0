# Solar Data Discovery Challenge

- This repository contains the Week 0 challenge for the 10 Academy training. Its purpose is to derive actionable solar insights through data analysis across Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo.

## Challenge Overview

- The following tasks are supposed to be done in  this challenge
  - Profile and clean environmental solar data.
  - Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and anomalies.
  - Compare solar metrics (GHI, DNI, DHI) across countries through visualizations and statistical tests.

## Steps & Plan

- Data Profiling, Cleaning, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Develop individual notebooks per country for statistics, missing-value reports, outlier detection, and visualizations.
- Cross-Country Comparison
- Consolidate cleaned data in one notebook to compare boxplots and summary statistics (mean, median, SD) with optional ANOVA tests.
- Implement modular, object-oriented code with effective error handling and detailed documentation.
- Build a Streamlit dashboard to visualize findings interactively.
